# Project-6
This project is a game of Tic Tac Toe.
In thie project I created a 3 by 3 matrix.
I assigned all the  elements of array to 5.
Then the players have to input the row number i and the column nunmber j.
For player 1 we assign 0 and for player 2 we assign 1.
If we get three zeros or three ones in a line then the player wins.
